# Outline of Introduction to Programming (CS100)

This project is intended for recitation of Introduction to Programming (CS100) at Shanghaitech. To help students understand the basic concepts of programming, we will use C and C++ to implement a simple ray tracer. During the process, we will cover the topics and concepts of programming C and C++ that related to the course on that week. The project is based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/).

## Project Configuration

Please refer to [Project Configuration of CS100 Recitaion](doc/Project Configuration of CS100 Recitaion.pdf).

### Week 1

1. Choosing the recitation class.

### Week 2

1. Introduction to C and C++.
2. Compiling and running a program through VS2022/GCC/Clang.
3. Introduction to the project.
4. Establishing the project environment.

### Week 3

1. Performing basic running command of the project.
2. Using Fixed width integer types (`uint32_t`).
3. Using `typedef` to define a new type.

### Week 4

1. Code abstraction (functions).

3. Seperation of rendering and output.
4. Assertion and error handling.
5. Generic selection (C11 standard).

### Week 6
