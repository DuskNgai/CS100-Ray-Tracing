# Outline of Introduction to Programming (CS100)

This project is intended for recitation of Introduction to Programming (CS100) at Shanghaitech. To help students understand the basic concepts of programming, we will use C and C++ to implement a simple ray tracer. During the process, we will cover the topics and concepts of programming C and C++ that related to the course on that week. The project is based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/).

## Weekly Schedule
